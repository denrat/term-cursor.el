;;; term-cursor.el --- Change cursor shape in terminal -*- lexical-binding: t; coding: utf-8; -*-

;; Version: 0.4
;; Author: h0d
;; URL: https://github.com/h0d
;; Keywords: terminals
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "26.1"))

;;; Commentary:

;; Change cursor shape in TTY Emacs according to what it would be in the GUI.
;; Send specific escape sequences to terminal emulator to trigger this cursor shape change.

;; Using VT520 DECSCUSR (cf https://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html).
;; Does not rely on `evil-mode' or any other dependency.
;; Does not interfere with GUI Emacs behavior.
